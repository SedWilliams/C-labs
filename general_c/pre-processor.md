# The pre-processor and linker

C has tools called the pre-processor and the linker.

The pre-processor is a program that runs before the compiler. It processes directives that start with `#`, such as `#include` and `#define`.

And the linker is a program that combines multiple object files into a single executable file. It resolves references to functions and variables across different files.

The pre-processor makes use of the linker in that way.
