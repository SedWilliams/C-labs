# Error Handling in C

C functions often indicate errors through their return values.

Like in Rust how results can be returned as Ok or Err, C functions often (not always)
return a -1 or Null to indicate an error, or the exepected value on success.

This is different from higher level languages that may
automatically raise and propogate exceptions (errors).
* Examples of automatic exception handling languages: Java, Python
